# Shubham Shrivastava — Developer Portfolio

A premium animated developer portfolio built with React, Vite, and Framer Motion.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** — lightning-fast build tool
- **React 18** — functional components with hooks
- **Framer Motion** — smooth, elegant animations
- **CSS Modules** — scoped component styling
- **React Router** — client-side routing
- **React Icons** — icon library

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Adding Your Profile Photo

Replace the placeholder at `public/profile.jpg` with your professional portrait image. The hero section will automatically display it in a circular frame with a glow effect.
